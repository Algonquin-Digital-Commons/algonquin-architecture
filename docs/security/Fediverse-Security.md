## Purpose and outcome

This specification defines **Fediverse Security** as part of the Post Secondary Digital
Commons. Its required outcome is defence in depth across identity, software supply chain, workloads, data, networks, clients, federation, and incident response. An implementation conforms
only when it satisfies this document, the linked ADRs, and the common
[Specification Completeness Standard](../architecture/Specification-Completeness-Standard.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** behaviour, interfaces, dependencies, data, security, deployment
  boundaries, capacity, failure handling, observability, validation, and lifecycle
  requirements for Fediverse Security.
- **Out of scope:** institution-specific hostnames, credentials, physical capacity,
  named operators, and legal approvals. Those values belong in signed institution
  deployment manifests and cannot redefine the common contract.
- **Authority:** the owning domain may make compatible implementation choices.
  Contract-breaking or cross-domain changes require an ADR and migration plan.

## Normative requirements

- The Fediverse Security capability SHALL provide defence in depth across identity, software supply chain, workloads, data, networks, clients, federation, and incident response.
- The capability SHALL have a versioned configuration schema, explicit safe
  defaults, validation before activation, and a reversible change procedure.
- User-visible and administrative behaviour SHALL be accessible, explainable,
  auditable, and bounded by institution policy and user authority.
- An implementation SHALL expose only the minimum capability required by its
  callers and SHALL reject unknown, unauthorized, malformed, expired, or
  unsupported requests with stable machine-readable errors.
- Institution deployments SHALL be independently operable and SHALL remain
  compatible with the common contract and conformance suite.

## Interfaces, APIs, events, and contracts

See [Interface controls](../architecture/Domain-Control-Profiles.md#security-profile); local extensions remain normative.

## Dependencies and ownership boundaries

Inherits [baseline ownership controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#ownership-and-dependency-boundaries).

## Data, state, residency, and retention

See [Data controls](../architecture/Domain-Control-Profiles.md#security-profile); local extensions remain normative.

## Security, privacy, safety, and compliance

See [Security controls](../architecture/Domain-Control-Profiles.md#security-profile); local extensions remain normative.

## Deployment, environments, and configuration

Inherits [baseline deployment controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#deployment-and-configuration).

## Capacity, scaling, cost, and sustainability

Inherits [baseline capacity controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#capacity-and-overload).

## Failure, recovery, and compatibility

See [Failure controls](../architecture/Domain-Control-Profiles.md#security-profile); local extensions remain normative.

## Observability, testing, and operational readiness

Inherits [baseline evidence controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence).

## Standards and implementation strategy

See [Standards controls](../architecture/Domain-Control-Profiles.md#security-profile); local extensions remain normative.

## Settled architecture constraints

- Security uses standard TLS/mTLS, PKI, identity, secret-management, signing, SBOM, and supply-chain mechanisms.
- Any custom policy or enforcement component must integrate established engines or standards before proposing a new language.
- Any exception follows the adopt → extend → compatible fork → build hierarchy and requires an ADR with evidence.

## Subject-specific control contract

| Dimension | Required definition |
|---|---|
| Owned responsibility | security controls for untrusted federated actors and instances |
| Authoritative input | signed activities, remote instance posture, media, reports, and moderation signals |
| Authoritative output | verified activity, rate decision, quarantine, block, or federation suspension record |
| Primary trust boundary | the local ActivityPub server and every remote server, actor, object, and media origin |
| Unsafe failure to prevent | forged, replayed, abusive, or policy-incompatible activity affects a local user |

- **SEC-FED-001:** The owner MUST implement the responsibility and preserve the input-to-output evidence chain shown above.
- **SEC-FED-002:** The enforcement point MUST fail closed when identity, policy version, integrity, freshness, or required context cannot be verified.
- **SEC-FED-003:** A release MUST include a positive conformance case, an unauthorized or malformed case, a dependency-loss case, and a regression case for the unsafe failure.
- **SEC-FED-004:** Exceptions MUST identify scope, compensating controls, approver, expiry, monitoring, and a removal plan; permanent undocumented bypasses are prohibited.

Institution forks MUST bind these controls to local identity, policy, evidence retention, and incident routes without weakening the common contract.

### Verification scenarios

1. Exercise security controls for untrusted federated actors and instances | with signed activities, remote instance posture, media, reports, and moderation signals | and prove the recorded result is verified activity, rate decision, quarantine, block, or federation suspension record |.
2. Remove or alter one required input and prove the request is denied without exposing protected diagnostic content.
3. Simulate the dependency or authority failure that could cause forged, replayed, abusive, or policy-incompatible activity affects a local user |; prove the declared safe state, revocation, and evidence are produced.

- ADR-0005: Standard Platform Primitives
- ADR-0012: Tenant-Neutral Post-Secondary Digital Commons

## Acceptance criteria

Inherits [baseline acceptance gates](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence); every local requirement MUST also pass.

## Enforcement

PSDC Security Working Group MUST enforce **Fediverse Security** at the declared policy, identity, repository, gateway, deployment, or moderation enforcement points. A request or change that does not satisfy the normative requirements MUST be denied or quarantined with a stable reason code. Enforcement decisions MUST be attributable, fail closed for authorization failures, and remain independently testable without relying on a proprietary service.

## Exceptions

An exception to **Fediverse Security** requires a written reason, affected scope, risk assessment, compensating control, approving role, start date, and expiry date. The subject owner MUST NOT self-approve a high-impact exception. Expired exceptions MUST stop applying automatically; renewal requires new evidence and review.

## Audit evidence

Conformance evidence for **Fediverse Security** MUST record the policy version, actor or service, decision, reason code, affected object or boundary, timestamp, outcome, and reviewer where applicable. Evidence MUST minimize protected data, be access-controlled, be exportable to the institution, and be retained according to the governing data policy. The owner MUST be able to demonstrate both an allowed and a denied case.

## Purpose

This policy defines the required outcome, actors, and decision boundary for **Fediverse-Security**. It applies to all implementations and institution overlays that claim conformance.

## Normative rules

The requirements in this document are normative. Owners MUST implement them, SHOULD document justified risk trade-offs, and MUST NOT treat an example as an exemption.

## Acceptance and review

Acceptance requires the documented controls, tests, operator ownership, and evidence to be complete. The owner reviews this policy on material architecture change and at least once per release cycle.
